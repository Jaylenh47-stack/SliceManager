# Who and Why
My name is Jaylen Hayden, a Year Up United student who was tasked with creating a point of sales application for a pizzeria for my capstone project. This application demonstrates my understanding of the course learnings so far, especially object oriented programming principles.

# What it does
The slice manager handles all of the procedures necessary for a pizzeria to get a customer to checkout.
The application starts by displaying the home screen

Pressing 1 takes you to the order menu where a customer can customize their order and checkout

When a customer is done with the checkout process the receipt is saved to the file.
